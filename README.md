# JAMStack + Netlify + Astra + Cassandra 📒
*10 minutes, Beginner, [Start Building](https://github.com/DataStax-Examples/todo-astra-jamstack-netlify#prerequisites)*

This is an example React To-Do application using a [DataStax Astra](https://astra.datastax.com/register?utm_source=devplay&utm_medium=github&utm_campaign=todo-astra-jamstack-netlify) free tier database.

## Objectives
* Provide a fullstack development example using Astra as the storage backend

## How this works
Once the Astra credentials are provided, the necessary tables are created in the database. The webservice will be available on port 8080 once the application has been deployed.

[JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/) is a big leap forward in how we can write web applications that are easy to write, deploy, scale, and also maintain. Using this approach means that newly created content is rendered from a content API, while a static render of it is being built into the site for future.

# Running JAMStack + Netlify + Astra + Cassandra 
Follow the instructions below to get started.

## Prerequisites
Let's do some initial setup by creating a serverless(!) database.

### DataStax Astra
1. Create a [DataStax Astra account](https://astra.datastax.com/register?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=todo-astra-jamstack-netlify) if you don't already have one:

2. On the home page. Locate the button **`Create Database`**

3. Locate the **`Get Started`** button to continue

4. Define a **database name**, **keyspace name** and select a database **region**, then click **create database**.  For this example you should use "netlify" and "todos".

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/synedra/netlify-astra-example)

6. In your local terminal, run `netlify login` to connect to the service.

7. Link your repository to the site you created with `netlify link`

8. Build your application `netlify build`

9. Set your environment variables on the Netlify site: `netlify env:import`

9. Run the application `netlify dev`

10. Open http://localhost:8080 to view your application:

11. Open your Netlify site in the browser: 
    * Run `netlify sites:list` to find your site URL
    * Launch your site using the URL in the list

7. You've deployed your app to Netlify!
